<h1><strong>Hi there! My name is Noah, and this is my official GitHub profile page.</strong></h1>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer that is currently learning the basic fundamentals of Web Development. I began my journey in Software Development back at the start of the COVID pandemic. I did not have a lot of time at the beginning, as I was still in my study books for an apprenticeship, and working full-time as an Apprentice Lineman. As I began spending more and more of my free time learning about coding, I was realizing that I wanted to eventually become a Software Engineer. I am now studying my fullstack JavaScript courses in <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?">The Odin Project</a>, as well as other online resources full-time. The more I am learning, the more I am excited to jump in to a project with others to see what we are capable of building together. I welcome anyone to join me on the journey through the wide world of Software! </p>
